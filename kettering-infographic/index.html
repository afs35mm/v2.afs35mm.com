					<span class="sub-hover">
						<p>"When I was chancellor of District of Columbia Public Schools from 2007 until late last year, we put a robust teacher evaluation system in place. However, before we got started, we came up with clear expectations. For example, teachers had to show they could deliver content in an understandable way and differentiate their instruction to reach a diverse group of kids.Once we raised awareness around what good teaching looked like, we tackled evaluations. It was a complete turnaround for the district. Like most, it had a weak system in which teachers were reviewed inconsistently and infrequently, leaving them without the feedback all professionals want and need." Michelle Rhee, 2011</p>
						<p>"Across the country, school systems are reinventing the ways they evaluate and provide feedback to teachers. Although I don't believe student test scores should be the sole factor in teacher evaluation, I believe just as strongly that they have an important role to play." Thomas Kane, Harvard Graduate School of Education, The Wall Street Journal, 2012</p>
						<p>"Let's talk about data.  I understand that word can make people nervous but I see data first and foremost as a barometer.  It tells us what is happening.  Used properly, it can help teachers better understand the needs of their students.  Too often, teachers don't have good data to inform instruction and help raise student achievement."

						<p>"The K-12 Common Core State Standards represent a major advance in standards for Mathematics and English Language Arts. They are grounded in evidence about what it takes for high school graduates to be ready for college and careers... They provide a clear and focused progression of learning from kindergarten to graduation that will provide teachers,administrators,parents and students with the information they need for student success."Michael Cohen,President, Achieve</p>

						<p>"The first principle of accountability for results involves the creation of standards in each state for what a child should know and learn in reading and math in grades three through eight. With those standards in place, student progress and achievement will be measured according to state tests designed to match those state standards and given to every child, every year. The new law will empower parents, citizens, educators, administrators and policymakers with data from those annual assessments." U.S. Department of Education, September, 2004</p>

					</a>
					<span class="sub-hover">
						<p>"Just as we must give teachers and schools the capability and flexibility to meet the needs of students, we must give parents a better portfolio of school choices. That starts with having the courage to replace or substantially restructure persistently low-performing schools that continuously fail our students. Closing a neighborhood school - whether it's in Southeast D.C., Harlem, Denver or Chicago - is a difficult decision that can be very emotional for a community. But no one ever said leadership is easy." How To Fix Our Schools: A Manifesto by Joel Klein, Michelle Rhee and Other Education Leaders, The Washington Post, 2010</p>

						<p>"Charter schools are accountable, first of all, to their customers. Second, they are accountable to the issuing body of the charter, whatever it may have been. Charter schools can be closed down either by customers who are not satisfied and pull their children out, or by the charter issuing body pulling the plug." Chester E.

							<li>Only 29 percent of Americans say they have "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in public schools. According to Gallup tracking surveys, this "establishes a new low in public school confidence."</li>

						Accountability reforms like<br> raising standards and<br> graudation requirements<br> and measuring<br>teacher performance<br>make sense.  
					</a>
					<span class="sub-hover">
						<p>Surveys show continuing support for the basic goals of the accountability movement-that American children can and should learn at higher levels, that students from all backgrounds should have the chance to succeed, and that principals and teachers should be well trained and energetic in helping students learn.  In fact, more than half of the parents (56 percent) say that enacting proposals to measure teacher effectiveness based on student performance should be a top priority for education reform.</p>
						<ul>	
							<li>"I really think that schools also are part of the problem," a Westchester mother said. "If my son is in sixth grade, and his teachers aren't qualified, they're not helping my son. I think schools have to be responsible for the teachers they're bringing in."</li>

						<p>Will It Be On The Test?</p> 
						<p style="font-style:italic;">The problem, as these parents saw it, is twofold. Parents have a hard time instilling good values in their own children because so many other parents are not responsible.  And the schools struggle to educate children because so many parents don't teach their children the behavior basics that enable them to study and cooperate in school. </p>

						<p style="font-style:italic;">Some 7 in 10 members of the public favormandatory testing of students in publicSchools.  But there are also clear signsfrom these focus groups that many parentsbelieve there is too much emphasis ontesting and that this may be distortingteaching and learning. Many told us thattest scores are only one measure among many other factors that should be weighed in judging schools, teachers, and students.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"I think that a few are fine, but I find that it takes a lot of manpower to get thosetests up and running. They teach to the test, to pass the test. It's a lot of energy.  That's why I was saying that I think that the schools aren't necessarily doing as well as they could because they're teaching to tests-where thekids are scoring high on them-but they'renot teaching them more creativity, more respect. " - a mother in Westchester (NY)</li>
							<li>"To me, tests are not as important as: Is the principal available? Are they doing things to improve? Is your child coming home... engaged in what he's doing in school? Is he learning? I think that's a big deal more than test scores." - a father in Detroit</li>

The better solution, many of them seem to say, would be to improve the quality of the neighborhood public schools in their own communities.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"There are enough students that Detroit public schools can exist. Detroit public charter schools can exist, and private schools can exist, but the thing is, I have the problem with [charter schools] trying to inundate the whole district and basically replace the district with charter schools.

					<span class="sub-hover">
						<p>Will It Be On The Test?</p>
						<p style="font-style:italic;">Getting more data-and having more transparent policies regarding school metrics-may be helpful, but what leaps out in direct conversations with parents is their hunger for two-way communications and for a personal relationship with the educators in their schools.</p>
						<p>"[They] send a lot of e-mails. [They] send a lot of newsletters. A lot of that is one-way communication. I think there's dialogue which is a different form of reaching out... I think they need to reach out [and] talk to parents about-not just we don't have enough money-but here's what our goals are." -a father in Westchester </p>
